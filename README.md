# Tasty-bites-dashboard-Tasty Bites Sales Dashboard â€“ Key Insights

I analyzed sales data across three branches (Downtown, Uptown, Suburb), using POWER BI and hereâ€™s what stood out:

âœ… Espresso & Latte lead in value, generating the highest revenue and unit price totals. Espresso alone accounted for over 464 in unit price, indicating strong customer demand and premium pricing power.

âœ… Downtown is the top-performing branch, both in revenue and pricing, suggesting it could serve as a model for underperforming branches like Suburb.

âœ… Sales dropped noticeably around June 3, after a strong end to May. This could signal a supply chain issue, weather-related slowdown, or event-based dip â€” worth further investigation.

âœ… Product revenue is well-distributed, with no single item dominating. Thatâ€™s a healthy sign of product balance.

ðŸ”Ž Observations:

Tea is underperforming in both revenue and pricing.

Uptown prices are more premium compared to Suburb, possibly due to local demographics.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations:

Replicate Downtownâ€™s approach in Suburb.

Reposition or reprice Tea for better traction.

Leverage Espresso & Latte in marketing campaigns.

Data isnâ€™t just numbers â€” itâ€™s a story. And this oneâ€™s all about knowing where to push, where to optimize, and where to dig deeper.
